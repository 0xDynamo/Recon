This Bash script automates the process of running several tools to enumerate subdomains of a specified domain. This is something I personally use for my own personal recon. The tools used are:

subfinder
crtsh
githubsubs
assetfinder
amass
asnmap
Usage
To run the script, use the following command:

Copy code
./script.sh [domain]
You can also use the -h flag to display a help message with usage instructions:

Copy code
./script.sh -h
If the domain is not provided as an argument, the script will prompt the user to enter it. The script will then create the subdomains folder if it does not exist, and run the tools with their flags and the entered domain. The output of each tool will be saved to the subdomains folder.

Requirements
Bash shell
The following tools must be installed and available in the PATH:
subfinder
crtsh
githubsubs
assetfinder
amass
asnmap
